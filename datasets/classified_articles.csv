For the first time in history, we are truly within reach of discovering an atmosphere around a potentially habitable rocky exoplanet,"" he said in an email.</p><p>The planets in TRAPPIST-1 have a range of conditions similar to the terrestrial planets in our solar system.</p><p>These conditions make them potential hosts for surface liquid water, but they require an atmosphere to prevent the water from freezing on the surface or sublimating to space, said Eric Agol, a professor in the department of astronomy at the University of Washington. Agol was not involved with the study but is working on the new set of observations with Espinoza and his colleagues.</p><p>TRAPPIST-1 e is the most promising of the seven planets for hosting an Earth-like atmosphere, according to Agol.</p><p>""The results are interesting, but also incomplete,"" he added in an email.</p><p>""I am agnostic about whether TRAPPIST-1 e may have an Earth-like atmosphere or not, and the current study hasn't affected my opinion.""</p><p>According to Howard Chen, an assistant professor of space sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology, TRAPPIST-1e sits right at a ""tipping point"" between opposite states, based on computer simulations that he detailed in a new study that published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p><p>Based on its history, the planet can emerge as either extremely dry or water-rich: ""That means both 'bare rock' and 'atmosphere-bearing' scenarios remain physically plausible,"" he added in an email. Chen was not involved with the new research.</p><p>TRAPPIST-1e could have formed as a desert world, like its inner neighbours, or as a wet, ocean-covered planet, he concluded.</p><p>""JWST's current data can't distinguish between those scenarios yet, but that ambiguity is exactly what our simulations predict,"" Chen said.</p><p>""The fact that TRAPPIST-1e can plausibly be either very dry or very wet means the next few JWST (observations) could deliver a dramatic reveal.""</p><p><a href=""https://www.9news.com.au/national/how-to-follow-9news-digital/29855bb1-ad3d-4c38-bc25-3cb52af1216f"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP</em></strong></a><strong><em>: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
